# Steam Market AutoSeller
Adds new "AutoSell" button near "Sell" to set selling price, tick SSA checkbox, confirm sale &amp; close dialog automatically.\
Also trims too long card descriptions &amp; hides "Scrap" section.\
Works only on this page: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/YOUR-NICKNAME/inventory/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/YOUR-NICKNAME/inventory/)\
